            we are surrounded with breathtaking wilderness, pure fresh air, secluded forests, pristine waters, an abundance of sunny

            <!-- COLUMN 2 -->
            Thank you for your interest in our Couples Resort.  Here you will find the time to spend quality time together, and this 
            is why we exist, to be here, so that you can spend lots of time together.  We, the Sorensen Family, started in 1967 to 
            take care of guests, in 1989 we moved to couples only (no kids and no meetings/conferences) as we knew that many couples 
            needed special time together.  In 2006, Canada Select which was rating 4000 accommodation properties in Canada, decided 
            we should join them because we were easily in the top 1%, a 5 Star, and we are glad we made it for you to enjoy as you 
            deserve it.  Now, many times of the year, we offer rates super discounted as we wish to be accessible to as many couples 
            as possible, as all couples should benefit from quiet time together.  We have learned over the decades from our guests 
            that those guests that have a love for gratitude for each other and for their surroundings are the happiest people, daily 
            I ask how grateful am I, and I hope you are filled with many things that you are grateful for.  If you know other couples 
            who need time away please pass on the word.
            <br><br>
            Your Hosts, The Sorensen Family & Team<br>
